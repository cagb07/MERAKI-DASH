## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.dev](https://v0.dev).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.dev](https://v0.dev).

## Local Development Setup

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed. Version 18.x or later is recommended. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **pnpm:** This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it after installing Node.js by running:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use `npm` or `yarn` if you prefer, but `pnpm` is recommended for consistency with the lockfile.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with the actual repository URL if different. If you've cloned this repository, you can skip this step and navigate to the project directory.)

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Using `pnpm`:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
    Or, if you're using `npm`:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or, using `yarn`:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended):**
    The application allows you to enter the Meraki API key directly in the UI.
    If you prefer to use an environment file for local development, create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add your Meraki API key:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_MERAKI_API_KEY=your_meraki_api_key_here
    ```
    **Note:** The application's current design primarily uses a UI dialog to input the API key. If you set this environment variable, you would need to modify the application logic (e.g., in `app/page.tsx`) to read and utilize this value, perhaps as a default or by bypassing the dialog if the variable is present.

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Using `pnpm`:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    Or, if using `npm`:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Or, using `yarn`:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    This will start the development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to see the application.

## Deployment

This Next.js application can be deployed to various platforms. Vercel is highly recommended as it's built by the creators of Next.js and offers seamless integration.

### Deploying with Vercel (Recommended)

The existing README already indicates that this project is deployed on Vercel, likely managed through `v0.dev`. If you are setting up your own deployment instance from a fork or managing it independently:

1.  **Sign Up/Log In:** Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up for a free account or log in.
2.  **Import Project:**
    *   From your Vercel dashboard, click on "Add New..." -> "Project".
    *   Connect your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) where your repository is hosted.
    *   Select your repository.
3.  **Configure Project:**
    *   Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project and configure most build settings.
    *   **Environment Variables:** For deployment, if you need to set the Meraki API key as an environment variable:
        *   Go to your project settings in Vercel -> "Environment Variables".
        *   Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_MERAKI_API_KEY` with your Meraki API key.
        *   **Note:** As with local setup, using this environment variable effectively would require modifications to the application logic to prioritize or use it over the UI input.
4.  **Deploy:** Click the "Deploy" button. Vercel will build and deploy your application.
5.  **Access Your Site:** Once deployed, Vercel will provide you with a URL to access your live application.

The project is currently live at the URL mentioned by `v0.dev`:

### Other Deployment Platforms

You can also deploy Next.js applications to other platforms such as:

*   **Netlify:** Offers similar features to Vercel with good Next.js support.
*   **AWS Amplify:** Provides a full-stack platform for web and mobile apps.
*   **Docker Container:** You can containerize your Next.js app and deploy it on any cloud provider that supports Docker (e.g., AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Instances).
*   **Node.js Server:** You can run a Next.js app on a traditional Node.js server using `next start` after building the project with `next build`.

Refer to the Next.js official documentation on [Deployment](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more detailed information on deploying to various platforms.
